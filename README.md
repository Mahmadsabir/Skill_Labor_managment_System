# Skill_Labor_managment_System
Skilled labour refers to workers who are expert in a field of their interest and are also  capable of solving any type of problems in that area.  Importance: People need labours who aid in the works concerned to homes, personal,  education etc. To mention some, a few services are electrician, carpenter, plumbers,  painters, masons, beauticians, baby care takers, chefs, physiotherapists, tailors, iron  workers, blacksmiths, gold smiths etc. These skilled workers are very much necessary in  our day-to-day life. For this, a bank of their information is needed to be created and  accessible to the people. Methodology: Create a database management system, which includes information of  skilled workers. Create a web site for people or clients to get information about them,  access their information and locate them also. Direct contact between skill labours and  clients. Acknowledgement of completion of work from both client as well as skill labour.
